# Preserving Family Histories:
Preserving Family Histories is a community data curation initiative aimed at documenting the vibrant historical memories from residents of along one West Philadelphiaâ€™s major financial and cultural corridor, 52nd Street. The Blackwell Free Library regional branch has partnered with the Re/Member Black Philadelphia project to encourage dialogue and collect oral histories documenting the significance of 52nd Street to West Philadelphia, in particular, the whole of Black Philadelphians more broadly. The Community Data Curation pilot, sponsored by the <b>Council on Library and Information Resources</b> and Penn Libraries, has provided the scanning technology to produce beautifully rendered, high-quality image collections and exhibits, and expertise to preserve the photographs, documents, ephemera and memorabilia that keep the corridor central to lived experience of the Black residences of Philadelphia. This digital community archive will host digitized material, exhibits, and collections while offering communities opportunities to ensure the longevity of their important historical records.
