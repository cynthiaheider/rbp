                <div id="panel1a" class="content inactive">
                    <p>Co-curated by RBP Project Director Krystal Strong and Mike Africa Jr., the Black Resistance Tour of Philadelphia is a physical and virtual guided tour of sites of Black resistance, which document ways ordinary Black folks have organized themselves to resist structural oppression. The Black Resistance Tour highlights Philly’s distinct forms of community-based cultural resistance as a vehicle for societal transformation. Despite the layers of collective trauma and harm woven into Philly’s most marginalized communities and neighborhoods, the city’s legacy of Black radical organizing persists through the cultivation of Black spaces of/through resistance.</p>

                <div id="panel1ab" class="content inactive">
                    <p>Preserving Family Histories is a community data curation initiative aimed at documenting the vibrant historical memories from residents along West Philadelphia’s major financial and cultural corridor,  52nd Street. The Blackwell Free Library regional branch has partnered with Re/Member Black Philadelphia project to encourage dialogue and collect oral histories about family histories and community memories in West Philadelphia and beyond. The Community Data Curation pilot, sponsored by the <b>Council on Library and Information Resources</b> and Penn Libraries, has provided the scanning technology to produce beautifully rendered, high-quality image collections and exhibits, and expertise to preserve the photographs, documents, ephemera and memorabilia that keep the corridor central to lived experience of the Black residents of Philadelphia. This digital community archive will host digitized material, exhibits, and collections while offering communities opportunities to ensure the longevity of their important historical records.</p>

                    <p>A joint project of MOVE (under the leadership of Mike Africa, Jr.), Re/Member Black Philly and the West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance, The MOVE Activist Archive preserves the organizational history and memory of The MOVE Organization’s resistance to state violence and state repression of MOVE activism. With the support of a Mellon Community-Based Archives grant, over the next two years and beyond, The MOVE Archive will work to: (1) preserve MOVE organizational materials that are privately held and currently vulnerable; (2) launch a MOVE digital archive; and (3) curate a multimodal exhibition of MOVE history through a series of community programs and immersive experiences. Together, these activities will preserve and amplify the history, memory, and ongoing activism of The MOVE organization and increase public engagement with the historical record and collective memory of one of the most important organizations to the history of Black activism in Philadelphia and global Black freedom struggles.</p>
